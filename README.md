# ModCraft
The framework framework

____

This is the core application framework extracted from [Curvy](https://github.com/DataDink/Curvy).
It allows me to create modular frameworks and applications and provides basic IOC
functionality.

Applications using ModCraft are built by creating Modules which will be assembled,
initialized, and loaded by the framework. Everything else is up to the developer.
